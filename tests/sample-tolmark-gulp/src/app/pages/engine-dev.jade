        h2 Simple Custom Engine Dev
        p Writing an engine is surprising simple. You have likely setup and configured your dev environment multiple times in the past. An engine simply formalizes this process for consistent sharable environments. Five bash scripts specify the services your framework needs and how they should be configured so devs can begin building their app immediately without manually installing or configuring anything.
